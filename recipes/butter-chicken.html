        <li>Tomatoes, pureed (fresh or canned)</li>

        <li>Cashew paste</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Marinating the Chicken:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine yogurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, garam masala, turmeric powder, chili powder, cumin powder, and salt to create the marinade.</li>
        <li>Add the boneless chicken pieces to the marinade, ensuring they are well-coated. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 1-2 hours, or preferably overnight, to allow the chicken to absorb the flavors.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Cooking the Chicken </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a skillet to a high temperature with some cooking oil or ghee.</li>
        <li>Cook chicken until it is tender and slightly charred on the edges.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Preparing the Tomato Sauce:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet or saucepan, melt butter over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add finely chopped onions and sauté until they turn translucent and start to brown.</li>
        <li>Add minced ginger, minced garlic, green cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, and bay leaves. Sauté for a couple of minutes until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low, and add heavy cream and cashew paste. Stir well to combine. You can adjust the cream and cashew paste quantities to achieve your desired level of creaminess.</li>
        <li>Add a pinch of sugar to balance the acidity. Season with salt to taste.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Combining and Simmering:</h3>
    <p>Add the cooked chicken pieces to the tomato sauce and simmer the mixture for about 10-15 minutes. This allows the chicken to absorb the flavors of the sauce.</p>
    <h3>Garnish and Serve:</h3>
    <p>Garnish the butter chicken with freshly chopped cilantro leaves and, if desired, a drizzle of cream.</p>
    <p>Serve hot with naan, rice, or your choice of Indian bread.</p>
    <p>Enjoy your homemade butter chicken! The dish is rich, creamy, and bursting with flavor.</p>
