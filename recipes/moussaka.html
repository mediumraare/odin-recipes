<li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
<li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Prepare the Eggplants:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice the eggplants into 1/4-inch rounds.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle both sides of the eggplant slices with salt to draw out moisture and let them sit for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Rinse the eggplant slices under cold water to remove the salt, then pat them dry with paper towels.</li>
        <li>Brush both sides of the eggplant slices with olive oil and arrange them on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Roast the eggplant slices in a preheated oven at 400°F (200°C) until they become tender and slightly browned, usually for about 15-20 minutes. Remove and set aside.</li>
       
    </ol>
    <h3>Prepare the Meat Sauce: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat some olive oil over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add chopped onions and garlic and sauté until they become translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef or lamb and cook until it's browned and fully cooked.</li>
        <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes or tomato sauce, red wine (if using), dried oregano, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Simmer the sauce for about 15-20 minutes until it thickens. Remove from heat</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Prepare the Bechamel Sauce:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a separate saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Stir in the flour to create a roux. Cook, stirring constantly, for a couple of minutes to remove the raw flour taste.</li>

        <li>Add nutmeg, salt, and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Beat the eggs in a separate bowl and gradually whisk them into the sauce.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Assemble and Bake:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Grease a large baking dish with olive oil.</li>
        <li>Layer half of the roasted eggplant slices on the bottom of the dish.</li>
        <li>Spread the meat sauce evenly over the eggplant layer.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining eggplant slices on top of the meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Pour the béchamel sauce over the entire dish, spreading it evenly.</li>
        <li>Place the moussaka in a preheated oven at 175°C and bake for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the top is golden brown and the moussaka is set.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Garnish and Serve:</h3>
    <p>Allow the moussaka to rest for about 15-20 minutes before slicing and serving.</p>
